# Interactive-Visualization-with-R

*Description of this project:  *
1) Web-scrape over 355,000 dog food ratings and reviews over the past 9 years since its establishment  
2) Interactive visualization of product diversity, review and rating details, statistical summary on Shiny Apps  
3) Estimate annual sales and generate word clouds for furthur prediction  
  
I'm a two-dog owner, and I love purchasing dog food and supplies from Chewy.com. It is an e-commerce giant in pet food field. So let's find out public opinion on its service.  
First, I web scrapped needed data for all dog food at Chewy.com, cleaned them, then did some statistical analysis.  
    Code of this part was in the file named `Code_webscrapping.R`.  
Second, I performed interactive visualization of these data, uploaded them on Shiny apps.  
    Code of this part was in the file named `Code_shinyapps.R`.  The clean dataset used in this step is `stats.r`.
Last, the shiny apps link is posted.
